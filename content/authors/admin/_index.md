Hi, I'm Zijian Dai! Currently, I am studying for a master's degree in robotics at **Harbin Institute of Technology,Shenzhen**. Before this I completed my B.Eng in automation at **Harbin Engineering University** with **Prof. Zheping Yan** and **Prof. Yongyao Chen**. During my academic career, I have worked on various types of robotics projects, including **quadruped robots**, **space robots**, **robotic arms**, **underwater robots**, **wheel robots**, etc. I am good at embedded development, ROS, and robot joint motion control such as servos/servo motors. My research interests include robot **compliant control**, **whole-body motion control**, and **real-world robotic system building**. Currently, I am working as an intern in motion control algorithms at **Tencent Robotics X Lab** and I am also looking for robotics **PHD opportunities** after my Master study.
