Hi, My name is Zijian Dai. Currently, I am a first-year PhD student majoring in robotics at **DIAG Robotics Lab**, supervised by **Prof. Giuseppe Oriolo (IEEE Fellow)**. In Mar 2025, I completed my M.Eng in Aerospace at **Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen**. Before this I completed my B.Eng in Automation at **Harbin Engineering University** with **Prof. Zheping Yan**. During my academic career, I have worked on various types of robotics projects, including humanoid, quadruped robots, space robots, robotic arms, underwater robots, wheel robots etc. I am good at embedded development, ROS, and robot joint motion control such as servos/servo motors. My research interests include robot **compliant control**, **whole-body motion control**, and **real-world robotic system building**. In Oct 2024, I finished my internship at **Tencent Robotics X Lab**. Later, I joined the humanoid project at **LimX Dynamics** and ended my internship in August 2025. Now, I am joining the **Automatic Control, Bioengineering and Operations Research (ABRO)** PhD program at **Sapienza University of Rome** for my PhD degree.
