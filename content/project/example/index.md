The utility model discloses a reversible quadruped wheel-legged robot, related to the technical field of wheel-legged robot equipment, including a robot base, said robot base includes a bottom plate and a first side plate; the beneficial effect of this utility model is that there are a robot base and wheel-leg assembly, when in use, through the operation of the first drive motor to drive the first left leg joints to turn, through the operation of the fourth drive motor to drive the fourth The left leg joint is rotated by the first drive motor, and the fourth drive motor is rotated by the fourth drive motor, which drives the wheel-leg assembly to be adjusted four times, and it can be compatible with the foot state and also retains the complex adaptability of the traditional quadrupedal robot, which is also suitable for field exploration, and through the operation of the four wheel-leg assemblies, it realizes an overall reversible quadrupedal wheel-legged robot, which is more flexible, and it can be adapted to a variety of application scenarios such as topographical surveys, industrial inspections, material handling and planetary exploration, which meets the needs of the use. It can be used in various application scenarios such as terrain survey, industrial inspection, material handling, planetary exploration, etc., to meet the needs of use.
