I addressed the issue of closed-chain force conflicts during the space truss crawling of a multi-arm robot. I proposed a whole-body compliant control strategy, analyzing the force mapping between interactive forces and the base, establishing a compliance model between the floating base and the end-effector Cartesian space.
